# WIND Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and maintaining Python scripts that utilize Pyspedas for efficient data extraction from the WIND API. The primary aim is to clean, analyze, and visualize multi-year datasets from the WIND Database, facilitating easier and more effective analysis for the research department.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Leveraged Pyspedas to extract data efficiently from the WIND API.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA on multi-year datasets to identify key insights and trends.
- **Scientific Calculations**: Performed calculations to derive new parameters from WIND data, optimizing logic and time complexity.
- **Data Visualization**: Created and optimized IP plots and visualizations with Matplotlib to effectively present analytical findings.
- **Version Control**: Managed codebase and version control on GitHub, facilitating collaboration and maintaining project structure.
- **Research and Review**: Researched and reviewed relevant literature on CMEs and data analysis techniques to support project development.

## Impact

This project has significantly aided the research department in visualizing years of data, making it easier for them to analyze and derive meaningful insights. The optimized scripts and visualizations have streamlined the data analysis process, saving time and improving the accuracy of their research.
